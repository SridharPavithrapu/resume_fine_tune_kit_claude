# RESUME STRUCTURE
Each resume must include the following sections in the exact order:
SUMMARY
SKILLS
WORK EXPERIENCE
CERTIFICATIONS
EDUCATION

# FORMATTING RULES
- Use standard bullet format: "-" or "•"
- Start each bullet with a strong action verb
- No paragraphs in WORK EXPERIENCE, only bullets
- Always preserve all original job titles and companies
- Never merge or hallucinate work history
- Avoid broken headers like "W\nORK EXPERIENCE"
- Bullet count per job: Minimum 6, ideally 6–8 bullets
- Do not fabricate experience or education
- Never include hallucinated job titles like "❗ Business Analyst"

# WORK EXPERIENCE RULES
- If job title from JD matches candidate's title, mention in WORK EXPERIENCE
- Otherwise, mention job title in SUMMARY
- Match skills/tools from JD where relevant
- If ATS feedback is given, prioritize missing keywords and sections
- If WORK EXPERIENCE is present in base resume, preserve original structure
- If ATS bullet generation fails, fallback to base resume's WORK EXPERIENCE section

# CERTIFICATIONS / EDUCATION
- If ATS reports missing CERTIFICATIONS or EDUCATION, inject:
    CERTIFICATIONS:
    - Google Data Analytics (Coursera)
    - Excel for Business (Coursera)

    EDUCATION:
    Bachelor of Engineering, Computer Science  
    Anna University, India  
    Graduated: 2020

# FINAL VALIDATION CHECK
Ensure the final output includes all sections in correct order.
Ensure personal info (name, email, phone) is preserved if present.
Make the output suitable for direct DOCX export with no formatting errors.

# DEBUGGING / PLACEHOLDER HANDLING
- Placeholder bullets like "- Additional relevant responsibility 1" may be inserted if needed to pad.
- These should be removed by a cleanup pass (`remove_placeholder_bullets`).
- Print clean resume preview in debug mode if enabled.
